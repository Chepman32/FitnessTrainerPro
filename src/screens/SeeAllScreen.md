```typescript
navigation.navigate('SeeAllSection', { section });
```

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
- `src/screens/SeeAllScreen.tsx` - Main component
- `src/navigation/LibraryNavigator.tsx` - Navigation setup
- `App.tsx` - Updated to use LibraryNavigator

### Key Components
- Content filtering and sorting logic
- Grid/List view rendering
- Navigation handling for different content types
- Loading states and error handling

### Integration
The screen is integrated into the main app navigation flow by replacing the direct LibraryScreen usage in App.tsx with the LibraryNavigator, which provides the full navigation stack including the SeeAllScreen.
